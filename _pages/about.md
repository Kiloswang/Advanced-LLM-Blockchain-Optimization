Welcome! This Reading Club, initiated by Prof. Hanzhang Qin (NUS) is a platform for scholars and students to explore the fast-evolving frontiers of artificial intelligence and distributed systems. Meeting weekly, the club focuses on discussing cutting-edge research papers that bridge large language models (LLMs), operations research, and blockchain technologies. It provides a collaborative environment where participants can learn about breakthrough developments of GenAI, examine how optimization and OR techniques can both leverage and enhance LLMs, and engage with ongoing research on distributed systems. Through presentations, note-sharing, and open discussions, the group aims to foster interdisciplinary understanding, spark new research ideas, and build a community that contributes to advancing intelligent and trustworthy systems.

If you are interested in joining us, please send me an email through(e1144136@u.nus.edu) with a brief introduction about yourself. People from different areas(including CS/OR/Finance/STAT...) are all welcomed!
